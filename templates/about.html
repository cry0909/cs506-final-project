            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project aims to predict the wait times at Starbucks based on factors such as time of day and day of the week. By analyzing historical data and training machine learning models, we strive to provide accurate predictions that can enhance customer experience and optimize staff scheduling.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Wait time data was collected at 15-minute intervals for four weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Features such as time and wait duration were extracted and cleaned.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> A Decision Tree Regressor was used to predict wait times.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).</li>
            </ol>
